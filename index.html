      <p>7668 active cases until today, 122 hospitalizations, 10 on ventilators. And SOMEHOW, RNS decides to still go back in person.</p>
      <p>Finished the debate case & went over it with Shreyas today, he can finish Gov case within 5 minutes, which is pretty good, despite he still stutters a little. We should be better at the time of the actual tournament.</p>
      <p>People came to fix the window of the bathroom on the 3rd floor and my dad's bedroom today, it couldn't remain open. Now it can and it looks a lot better. Took about 4 hours (8:15 AM - around 12 PM).</p>
      <p>Regarding RNS and covid again. Cole said that the reason we're going back in person could be that RNS remaining open during the pandemic was a big selling factor for some new families this year, and I think also that they need to refund us if its in-person. Nothing beats in-person school, my ass. Just pure capitalism.</p>
      <p>Some people are coming back from Mexico, some from Toronto, some from other places. We're gonna have the biggest outbreak ever tomorrow. There's no way I go to eat lunch, despite McEvoy telling me that there will not be mandatory lunch. Not taking off my mask any time tomorrow. I'll try and find a KN95 as well so I don't have to switch it midway.</p>
      <p>Let's see if I survive.</p>

      <p>The snowstorm was insane, see picture below. Never seen it snow this much in my entire life. Spent like 2 hours clearing off just the back yard, back hurts like hell. Never doing it again.</p>
      <p style="text-decoration: line-through;">Global warming is fake</p>
      <p>That was a joke if you didn't realize. Anyways, I finished the government case for debate, and before my philosophy teacher responds to my email I won't be doing philosophy in the forseeable future. School starts soon so there's always that.</p>
      <p>Might get on the Hypixel SMP a bit before school starts. Finish that nether railroad.</p>

      <h5>Snowstorm</h5> 
      <p>This post will be in Mandarin.</p>
      <p>怎么说也过了一年半左右了。前年十月份那会那种天塌了的感觉也不会再有了，毕竟比当时成熟了嘛。但是今天看到你还在关心我们的视频真是忍不住哭了。</p>
      <p>怎么说呢…前年七月份还是六月份那会吧，因为回不去国内，在这边也没什么朋友，每天负能量叠加到最后脑子里想到的只有各种死法。大概也是在那个时候读的自杀手册。不过后来偶然在b站刷到了你的视频，记得是“夏色祭狂笑十分钟耐久”来着wwww。</p>
      <p>当时想到的就是这个东西好蠢，然而不知不觉就关注起来了。夏色祭呼吸也好，伤心也好，交朋友也好，从一开始仅仅觉得很有趣到真正投入情感的转变真的很快。嘛，我也没花什么真金白银就是了。</p>
      <p>究竟是什么东西吸引了我，我也不清楚。然而每天晚上十一点（时差党www）等着协会更新仿佛给了我一点希望。每天开始锻炼，学习，读书，出门打球，和朋友聊天，似乎生活一点点回到正轨了。真了不起呢，夏色祭。</p>
      <p>然后看直播的时候都会算时差然后想“这个时间点还直播真的不要紧么”，感觉就像老父亲一样ww。夏色祭大概已经成为我生活的一部分了吧。之前那种阴暗的感觉已经没有了，真了不起呢，夏色祭。</p>
      <p>然后就开学了，对我而言倒也没什么区别。一个月后那件事发生了。当时就是祈祷着不要让事态扩张到不可控制的地步，然而还是发生了。我们还是说了再见。在那几周都不在状态，倒也可以理解吧，毕竟生活的重要组成部分被夺走了。</p>
      <p>那个时候的光消失了。然而对我而言也没什么大不了，我当时已经从那个黑暗的深渊里爬出来了。然而几个月后，对死亡的恐惧又战胜了我，把我拉回了更黑暗的深渊。</p>
      <p>记不清是十一月的什么时候了，我用水果刀对着自己的脖子大概有半个小时吧，最后还是放下了。不管是老师，同学，朋友，还是家人都没人在乎这件事情。好几个月都无法走出那种阴暗的感觉，说不定现在也还在影响着我呢。当时也时不时的会想，如果你还在的话就好了。</p>
      <p>也曾经试着去看老视频来治愈自己，然而带来的只有更深的抑郁和怀旧。不过幸好最后还是靠自己走了出来，现在怀着更坚定的信仰准备继续走下去。恩，我也很了不起呢。</p>
      <p>嘛，关于我的故事也说的够多了。……真是个傻瓜呢，夏色祭。如果没有看到那个视频的话，至今为止都会以为你是主动离开的吧。为什么要让自己这么不好受啊。明明和你的同事们一样放下我们继续去赚钱不就好了，这部本身就是份工作嘛，哪有干出感情的啊……笨蛋</p>
      <p>是不是脑子坏掉了啊……真是的。国内的这些人对自己大大咧咧的，然而对你却比什么都心细啊。以后的路就要你自己走了，多加小心啊，傻成这个样子可不行……祭以后可不能继续当笨蛋了，要说好了哦</p>
      <p>那就这样吧。如果可以的话，期待下一次与你相见时那一句元气的“夏色祭参上“。如果不能再见的话，那么祝你前程似锦，人生顺利。不管走什么样的道路我都会支持你的。</p>
      <p>那么。夏色祭，一路顺风。</p>

      <p>Not much happened. Had my second driving lesson, coach is feeling better and said I need to practice turning more. Finish the philosophy unit. I'm writing this at 1 AM in the morning.</p>
      <p>The reason I'm still up at this hour is Sherry Nolan, she changed the debate resolution for provincials to something new completely. Prepping my ass off right now.</p>
      <p>0 Ground for government case. I don't even know how she can persistently come up with new trashier resolutions. Sherry Nolan never fails to disappoint. Here's a pic of what I have so far.</p>

      <p>Also, snowstorm tomorrow. Gonna grind my case I guess, originally planning to go practice driving at QPlex.</p>

      <p>Literally nothing happened today. French class happened. I made this entry to remind myself of how bad covid is. I will write the following in two languages.</p>
      <p>Covid can and have (from the very 1st case) affect other organs than the lungs and the respiratory system. Cases have been reported where covid affected the brain. It is also possible that covid cannot be detected by any means of covid testing that exists in the present day. In fact, covid tests are only 50% accurate. All vaccines are void against the omicron variant. A woman died in LA 4 days after contracting the virus, showing 0 symptoms whatsoever and her dead body tested negative for covid, she died from a cerebral hemorrhage.</p>
      <p>新冠病毒可以影响呼吸系统以外的器官。武汉第一例病例脑髓液就测出了新冠病毒。核酸和其他检测方式至多50%有效，多例无症状感染者可因新冠而脑出血死亡。疫苗针对最新的奥米克隆变种几乎完全无效。LA女人病例，尸体核酸阴性，且感染病毒后四天内完全无症状暴毙，死因是脑出血。</p>
      <p>Stay safe.</p>

      <h5>Raining</h5> 
      <p>Aaaaand of course it rains today when everyone thinks the snow can finally pile up for a bit.</p>
      <p>Went to someone else's place (海平阿姨) with some friends today for Lunch. Got really bored later because there were literally nothing to do, so I finished my daily dose of philosophy course there instead. Finally moved on to communism and socialism, the course isn't too biased.</p>
      <p>Prepped some debate after I got home. Dinner is leftover pizza. Tried K3 for the first time in a while, got destroyed, but its possible. Next goal is K3 but with shorter breaks.</p>
      <p>The anime yesterday really made me consider some life choices. I really miss the times when I'm younger, and I realized just how much I've been wasting my time.</p>
      <p>First day in 2022. At least I'll have a chance to change. Life is much less desirable now when compared to 10 years or even 5 years ago, but I still have a chance to change. Gotta enjoy life as is. I bet 5 or 10 years later I'll be looking back and be envious of myself right now.</p>
      <p>Obviously, this is not to say that my life is desirable or enjoyable. However, as things only go downhill, I might as well take what I can and keep it in my memory.</p>
      <p>So yeah. That anime was really good btw. Its name is Erased（只有我不在的街道）, if you didn't see the third entry.</p>

      <h5>Cloudy</h5> 
      <p>Helped my dad clean the back yard of snow this morning. Fixed some issues with the blog. Finished correcting philosophy essays. Did some further research regarding debate.</p>
      <p>Played minecraft. Watched anime, which I will get to in a bit. Dinner was veggie pizza and meat, delicious as always.</p>
      <p>The debate topic this time ("This House would support a ban on cryptocurrency") is sort of hard to prep for. I have no idea what crypto is, but now I generally have something along the lines of a case. Talking to Shreyas, my partner, on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Regarding the anime, it's called Erased（只有我不在的街道）, recommended by Umar. It was really good. Finished it in an afternoon, about 12 episodes. The plot was near perfect.</p>
      <p>还有你们能不能别再说什么范式狂喜，牛头人之类的啊，这东西跟牛头人根本不沾边好吧，怎么看八代和男主都没什么浪漫感情啊，差不多一点啊你们这些人，我都哭了然后看评论区全是“牛头人”真的很破坏气氛啊喂</p>
      <p>Happy new year! Next year I'll be someone else. I will work harder. I will push myself harder. Most importantly, I'll be a better person. Those are my resolutions.</p>
      <br><p>Oh and also, I feel like I can start doing the K3 from the Keep App tomorrow in temrs of physical exercise.</p>

      <p>Sleepy as heck, tried for an afternoon to add pages to this website and failed. Formatting error. Guess I'll use collapse instead for now.</p>
      <p>Did some more philosophy work and carried on with my daily routine. All should be good. Driving class got cancelled because teacher was sick. Hopefully its not CoVID.</p>

      <p>Dinner was delicious. Ate some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanghulu" target="_blank">Chinese dessert</a>, maybe I need to work out more.</p>
      <p>Finished the book Mao's Great Famine. Have a few opinions on it that I need to tell McEvoy.</p>
